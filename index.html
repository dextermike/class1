            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate from Wilfird Laurier University finishing with a bachelors of arts in Law and Society. I have decided to change into the IT area of work due to my current intrest in cybersecurity and fond of learning a new evolving industry. I am completely new in this field with no background knowledge on any programs. I hope after compeleting this project I am able to explore the world of web design and devlopment and work on projects that will impact and help the world.</p>
